<h1 align="center">BastionCMD Server</h1>
<p align="center"><strong>The server for BastionCMD</strong></p>
This is the API for BastionCMD, containing all the information that is being pulled from the internet by the client. It contains files about the version, and also data for the actions. You can actually host this server yourself! Here's how you can do that:

## Setting up the Server, so you can run it yourself.

1. Paste the files from the server on any web server, so that you can view them in a browser.

2. Go to the client, and edit `server.py`. You need to change the `server_url` string to the URL of your server.

3. Everything should work correctly. Ask for help in our Discord server.
